0. In line 1, method `convert` of class `FizzBuzzTDD` is invoked.
1. The given method is named `convert`, it takes an integer `i` as a parameter, and returns a String.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The method `convert` is declared as `public static`. This means that it can be accessed from any other class and can be called without creating an instance of the `FizzBuzzTDD` class.

2. The method checks if the given integer `i` is divisible by 15 without any remainder using the expression `0 == i % 15`. If it is true, the method returns the string "FizzBuzz".

3. Next, the method checks if the given integer `i` is divisible by 5 without any remainder using the expression `0 == i % 5`. If it is true, the method returns the string "Buzz".

4. If the above conditions are not met, the method checks if the given integer `i` is divisible by 3 without any remainder using the expression `0 == i % 3`. If it is true, the method returns the string "Fizz".

5. If none of the above conditions are met, the method returns the string representation of the integer `i` by concatenating it with an empty string.

Overall, this method is a part of a FizzBuzz program implementation, where it checks if a given integer is divisible by 15, 5, or 3 and returns the corresponding string value ("FizzBuzz", "Buzz", "Fizz") or the string representation of the integer itself.
2. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `String` is created.
