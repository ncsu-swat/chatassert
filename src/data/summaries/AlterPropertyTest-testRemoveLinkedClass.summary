4. In line 2, method `createClass` of class `OSchema` is invoked.
5. Certainly! The code snippet you've provided is a method definition for the `createClass` method of the `OSchema` class. Let's break it down:

- The method is declared with a return type of `OClass`. This suggests that when this method is invoked, it creates and returns an object of type `OClass` or a subclass of it.
- The method name is `createClass`, indicating that it is used to create a new class within the schema.
- The method takes one parameter of type `String`, which is named `iClassName`. This parameter represents the name of the class that is being created.
- The semi-colon at the end of the line denotes the end of the method's declaration.

To summarize, invoking this method provides a way to create a new class within the schema. The name of the class should be passed as a string to the `iClassName` parameter. The method then returns an object of type `OClass`, representing the newly created class.
6. Take note that in line 3, method `createClass` from class `OSchema` is invoked.
7. In line 4, method `createProperty` of class `OClass` is invoked.
8. Certainly! Here's an explanation of the method you provided:

- The method is declared with a return type of `OProperty`, indicating that it returns an object of type `OProperty` or a subclass of it.
- The method name is `createProperty`, suggesting that it is used to create a new property within the class.
- The method takes three parameters:
  - `iPropertyName`: This parameter is of type `String` and represents the name of the property being created.
  - `iType`: This parameter is of type `OType` and represents the data type of the property.
  - `iLinkedClass`: This parameter is of type `OClass` and represents the linked class, if the property is a reference to another class.

In summary, invoking this method allows you to create a new property within a class. You pass the name of the property as a string to the `iPropertyName` parameter. The data type of the property should be specified using the `OType` enumeration in the `iType` parameter. If the property is a reference to another class, you can specify the linked class using the `OClass` object in the `iLinkedClass` parameter. The method then returns an object of type `OProperty`, representing the newly created property.

- The interface extends `ODocumentWrapper`, which suggests that it provides functionality for working with OrientDB documents.
- It declares multiple methods, each representing a specific operation or functionality. Some of the notable methods include:

  - `countClasses()` returns the number of classes in the schema.
  - `createClass()` is overloaded with different variations to create classes within the schema.
  - `dropClass()` removes a class from the schema.
  - `getClass()` is overloaded and retrieves an `OClass` instance based on different parameters such as class name or class type.
  - `getOrCreateClass()` is overloaded to either retrieve an existing class or create a new class if it doesn't exist.
  - `getClasses()` returns a collection of all classes in the schema.
  - `save()` and `reload()` methods are used to persist or reload the schema.
  - `getClassesRelyOnCluster()` returns all the classes that rely on a specific cluster.
  - `getGlobalPropertyById()` retrieves a global property based on its ID.

Additionally, the interface includes constants for compatibility and versions.

In summary, this interface defines methods for managing, creating, and retrieving classes and properties in the schema, as well as for working with global properties and clusters.
11. In line 2, an object of class `OClass` is instantiated
12. The code you provided is an interface named `OClass` which represents a class in the OrientDB's schema. Here are some important points to note about this code:

- The interface belongs to the package `com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema`.

- It extends the `Comparable<OClass>` interface, which means that `OClass` objects can be compared to each other based on their properties.

- The interface contains several inner enums such as `ATTRIBUTES` and `INDEX_TYPE`, which define different attributes and index types associated with the class.

- The interface declares methods for various operations related to class management and manipulation. Some of the notable methods include:

  - Methods to query and modify the properties of the class, such as `declaredProperties()`, `properties()`, `propertiesMap()`, `getProperty()`, `createProperty()`, `dropProperty()`, etc.

  - Methods to handle the super classes and sub classes, such as `getSuperClass()`, `setSuperClass()`, `getSuperClassesNames()`, `getSuperClasses()`, `setSuperClasses()`, `addSuperClass()`, `removeSuperClass()`, etc.

  - Methods to handle indexes associated with the class, such as `createIndex()`, `getInvolvedIndexes()`, `areIndexed()`, `getClassIndex()`, `getClassIndexes()`, `getIndexes()`, etc.

  - Methods to manage clusters associated with the class, such as `getClusterIds()`, `addClusterId()`, `removeClusterId()`, `getPolymorphicClusterIds()`, etc.

  - Methods to handle class metadata and custom attributes, such as `getDescription()`, `setDescription()`, `getShortName()`, `setShortName()`, `getCustom()`, `setCustom()`, etc.

  - Methods for class hierarchy and inheritance, such as `isSubClassOf()`, `isSuperClassOf()`, `getBaseClasses()`, `getAllBaseClasses()`, `getSubclasses()`, `getSuperClasses()`, etc.

- The interface also declares some utility methods like `getSize()`, `count()`, `isEdgeType()`, `isVertexType()`, etc.

In summary, the `OClass` interface defines a set of methods for managing and manipulating classes in the schema of an OrientDB database, including operations related to properties, indexes, clusters, inheritance, and metadata.

15. The provided class code is an interface named `OProperty`. Here are some important details to note about this code:

- The interface belongs to the package `com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema`.
- It extends the `Comparable<OProperty>` interface, suggesting that `OProperty` objects can be compared to each other based on their properties.
- The interface declares several constants in the `ATTRIBUTES` enum. These constants represent different attributes associated with a class property, such as `LINKEDTYPE`, `LINKEDCLASS`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `MANDATORY`, etc.
- The interface declares methods for various operations related to managing and manipulating a property within a class. Some notable methods include:
  - `getName()` and `getFullName()` retrieve the name and full name of the property, respectively.
  - `setName()` changes the name of the property.
  - `set()` allows setting different attributes of the property by taking an `ATTRIBUTES` constant and a value.
  - `getType()` returns the data type of the property.
  - `getLinkedClass()` and `setLinkedClass()` handle the linked class associated with the property.
  - `getLinkedType()` and `setLinkedType()` manage the linked type of the property.
  - `isNotNull()` and `setNotNull()` handle whether the property can be null or not.
  - `getCollate()` and `setCollate()` manage the collation of the property.
  - `isMandatory()` and `setMandatory()` handle whether the property is mandatory or not.
  - `isReadonly()` and `setReadonly()` manage whether the property is read-only or not.
  - `getMin()` and `setMax()` handle the minimum and maximum values for the property, depending on the property's data type.
  - `getDefaultValue()` and `setDefaultValue()` handle the default value of the property.
  - `createIndex()` is used to create an index on the property, with different options for index types.
