3. This method, `splitShortToBuffers`, takes three parameters: `buffer`, `buffer1`, and `iValue`.

The purpose of this method is to split a `short` value into two parts and store them in separate `ByteBuffer` objects.

In the method body:
- `buffer.put((byte) (MASK & (iValue >>> SIZE_OF_BYTE_IN_BITS)))` writes the first part of the `short` value to the `buffer` object. In this line, the `>>>` operator is used to perform a logical right shift by the size of a byte in bits, which is 8. This ensures that only the first byte of the `short` value is retained. The `(byte)` cast is used to convert the result to a `byte` value.
- `buffer1.put((byte) (MASK & iValue))` writes the second part of the `short` value to the `buffer1` object. The `MASK` constant is used to mask out all but the least significant byte of the `short` value.

By calling this method, you can split a `short` value and store its parts in separate `ByteBuffer` objects.

7. Sure. This method, `mergeShortFromBuffers`, takes two parameters: `buffer` and `buffer1`, both being `ByteBuffer` objects.

The purpose of this method is to merge two bytes from different `ByteBuffer` objects into a single `short` value.

In the method body:
- `short result = 0;` initializes a `short` variable named `result` with a value of 0.
- `(short) (result | (buffer.get() & MASK));` reads a byte from the `buffer` object using the `get()` method, applies a bitwise AND operation with the `MASK` constant, and performs a bitwise OR operation with the `result` variable. The resulting value is then cast to a `short` and assigned back to `result`. This extracts the first byte of the `short` value from the `buffer` object.
- `(short) (result << SIZE_OF_BYTE_IN_BITS);` shifts the bits of `result` to the left by the number of bits in a byte, which is equivalent to multiplying `result` by 256. This prepares the leftmost byte of the `short` value to be merged with the second byte.
- `(short) (result | (buffer1.get() & MASK));` reads a byte from the `buffer1` object and follows a similar process as before to extract the second byte of the `short` value. The extracted byte is then combined with the prepared leftmost byte using a bitwise OR operation.
- The merged `short` value is then returned as the result.

By calling this method, you can merge two bytes from different `ByteBuffer` objects and obtain a `short` value.
