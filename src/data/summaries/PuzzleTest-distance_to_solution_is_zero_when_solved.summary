0. In line 1, an object of class `Puzzle` is instantiated.
1. The given code is a constructor for the class `Puzzle`. 

Here's an explanation of the code:
- The constructor is declared with the access modifier `public`, indicating that it can be accessed from other classes.
- The constructor has a parameter `cells` of type `int[]` which represents an array of integers.
- Inside the constructor, the`this.cells` variable is assigned the value of the `cells` parameter. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object of the `Puzzle` class, and `cells` is an instance variable of the class.

In simple terms, when a new `Puzzle` object is created with an array of integers as a parameter, the constructor assigns the passed array to the `cells` variable of that `Puzzle` object.
2. In line 1, method `getSolution` of class `PuzzleTest` is invoked.
3. The given code defines a method named `getSolution` with a return type of `int[]` (an array of integers). 

Here's an explanation of the code:
- The method is declared with the access modifiers `private` and `static`. `private` means that the method can only be accessed within the same class, and `static` means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.
- Inside the method, a new array of integers `{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }` is created and initialized.
- The newly created array is then returned from the method using the `return` keyword.

In simple terms, when the `getSolution` method is invoked, it creates and returns a new array containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `Puzzle` is created.
