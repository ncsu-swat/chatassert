1. In line 1, an object of class `DroppingRavenLoggingFilter` is instantiated
2. The code above defines a class called `DroppingRavenLoggingFilter` in the package `com.tradier.raven.filters`. 

This class extends the `Filter` class from the Logback logging framework, specifically for filtering log events of type `ILoggingEvent`. The `Filter` class is used to filter log events and determine whether they should be accepted, denied, or skipped.

Within the `DroppingRavenLoggingFilter`, there is an overridden `decide` method. This method takes an `ILoggingEvent` as a parameter and returns a `FilterReply`. The `decide` method is responsible for making the decision on how to filter the log event.

In the implementation of the `decide` method, it checks if the logger name of the log event starts with `"com.getsentry.raven"`. If it does, it returns `FilterReply.DENY`, indicating that the log event should be denied or skipped. Otherwise, it returns `FilterReply.NEUTRAL`, indicating that the log event should be neither accepted nor denied.

Essentially, this `DroppingRavenLoggingFilter` class filters out log events that are generated by the `com.getsentry.raven` logger.
