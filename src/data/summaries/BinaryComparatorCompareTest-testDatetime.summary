0. In line 1, method `testCompareNumber` of class `BinaryComparatorCompareTest` is invoked.
1. The `testCompareNumber` method takes two parameters - `sourceType` of type `OType` and `value10AsSourceType` of type `Number`. 

In this method, an array `numberTypes` is defined with various types of numbers: `OType.BYTE`, `OType.DOUBLE`, `OType.FLOAT`, `OType.SHORT`, `OType.INTEGER`, `OType.LONG`, and `OType.DATETIME`. 

The method then iterates over each element `t` in `numberTypes` using a for-each loop. If `sourceType` is `OType.DATETIME` and `t` is `OType.BYTE`, it skips the test. Otherwise, it calls the `testCompare` method with `sourceType` and `t` as parameters.

After that, it iterates over each element `t` in `numberTypes` again and calls the `testCompare` method with `t` and `sourceType` as parameters.

There is an additional check for `sourceType` not being `OType.DATETIME`. Inside this check, several assertions are made to compare `sourceType` with `OType.STRING` and `value10AsSourceType` with different string representations. These assertions check if the comparison results are as expected.

Overall, this method tests the comparison of the given `sourceType` with various number types and string representations.
