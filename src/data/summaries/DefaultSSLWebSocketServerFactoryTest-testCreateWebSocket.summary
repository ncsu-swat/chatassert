0. In line 1, an object of class `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` is instantiated.
1. Certainly! 

The given constructor `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` takes an `SSLContext` object as a parameter. The `SSLContext` class provides access to the implementation's SSL or TLS settings. It is used to create and manage secure sockets for communicating over a network.

In the constructor code, the `this` keyword refers to the current object being instantiated. The constructor is calling another constructor of the same class using the `this` keyword. A parameter similar to the one provided in the first constructor is passed to this constructor as well.

The `Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()` method creates an `ExecutorService` that can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically. It creates a new single-threaded executor. This executor service is used as a second parameter in the constructor.

So, in summary, the given constructor instantiates an object of `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` by assigning the provided `SSLContext` object to `sslContext`, and creating a new single-threaded executor service using `Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()`.
2. Take note that in line 1, method `getDefault` from class `SSLContext` is invoked.
3. Take note that in line 2, constructor `CustomWebSocketAdapter` from class `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactoryTest.CustomWebSocketAdapter` is invoked.
4. In line 3, an object of class `Draft_6455` is instantiated.
5. Certainly! 

The constructor `Draft_6455` is defined in the class `Draft_6455`. It is used to create an object of type `Draft_6455`, which represents the websocket protocol specified by RFC 6455.

This constructor has no parameters, and it is annotated with the `@since 1.3.5` annotation, indicating that it has been available since version 1.3.5.

The constructor body consists of a single line: `this(Collections.<IExtension>emptyList())`. 

In this line, the `Collections.<IExtension>emptyList()` method is invoked. This method returns an empty list of type `List<IExtension>`. The `IExtension` is a generic interface that represents a websocket extension.

The returned empty list is then passed as an argument to the constructor of the same class using the `this` keyword. This effectively calls another constructor within the same class, passing an empty list of extensions.

So, in summary, the `Draft_6455` constructor creates an object of type `Draft_6455` representing the websocket protocol specified by RFC 6455. It sets the list of extensions to an empty list by calling another constructor within the same class.
6. In line 3, method `createWebSocket` of class `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` is invoked.
7. Certainly! 

The given code represents the implementation of the `createWebSocket` method in the `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` class. This method is annotated with `@Override` to indicate that it overrides a method from a superclass or interface.

The `createWebSocket` method takes two parameters: `WebSocketAdapter a` and `Draft d`. 

Inside the method body, a new object of type `WebSocketImpl` is created by using the constructor `WebSocketImpl(a, d)`. The `WebSocketImpl` class represents the WebSocket implementation.

The constructor `WebSocketImpl(a, d)` of the `WebSocketImpl` class takes the `WebSocketAdapter` object `a` and the `Draft` object `d` as parameters. It initializes the `WebSocketImpl` object with the provided values.

Finally, the method returns the newly created `WebSocketImpl` object.

In summary, the `createWebSocket` method in the `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` class creates and returns a new `WebSocketImpl` object by using the provided `WebSocketAdapter` and `Draft` objects.
8. In line 1, an object of class `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` is instantiated
9. This class represents the implementation of a default SSL WebSocket server factory. Let's go through the code step by step:

- The class starts with a comment block indicating the copyright notice and licensing information.
- The package declaration `org.java_websocket.server` defines the package in which the class resides.
- The class imports various required classes and interfaces from the `java.nio.channels`, `javax.net.ssl`, and `org.java_websocket` packages.
- The class `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` implements the `WebSocketServerFactory` interface, indicating that it provides the implementation for creating WebSocket servers.
- The class has a `protected` field `sslcontext` of type `SSLContext` which represents the SSL/TLS context used for secure WebSocket connections.
- The class also has a `protected` field `exec` of type `ExecutorService` which represents the executor service used for managing server tasks asynchronously.
- The class has two constructors: 
  - `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory(SSLContext sslContext)` which takes an `SSLContext` object as a parameter. It assigns the provided `sslContext` to the `sslcontext` field and creates a new single-threaded executor service using `Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()` and assigns it to the `exec` field.
  - `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory(SSLContext sslContext, ExecutorService exec)` which takes both an `SSLContext` object and an `ExecutorService` object as parameters. It assigns the provided values to the `sslcontext` and `exec` fields respectively.
- The class overrides several methods defined in the `WebSocketServerFactory` interface.
  - The `wrapChannel` method wraps a `SocketChannel` with an SSL channel by creating an `SSLEngine`, configuring it, and returning a new `SSLSocketChannel2` object that wraps the given `SocketChannel` and `SSLEngine`.
  - The `createWebSocket` methods create and return a new `WebSocketImpl` object by invoking the corresponding constructor of the `WebSocketImpl` class with the provided `WebSocketAdapter` object and `Draft` object or `List<Draft>` object.
  - The `close` method shuts down the executor service.
 
Overall, the `DefaultSSLWebSocketServerFactory` class provides the default implementation for creating SSL-based WebSocket servers. It handles creating secure channels, managing executor services, and creating new WebSocket instances.

11. In line 3, an object of class `Draft_6455` is instantiated
12. The given code defines a class named `Draft_6455`, which is an implementation of the RFC 6455 WebSocket protocol. Let's break down the code:

- The class is defined within the package `org.java_websocket.drafts`.
- The class imports various classes and interfaces from different packages, necessary for its functionality.
- The class extends the `Draft` class, which is an abstract class defining the common behavior for different WebSocket drafts.
- The class starts with a comment block indicating the copyright notice and licensing information.
- The class includes several constant fields representing specific headers and values used in the handshake process of the WebSocket protocol.
- The class contains several private fields, including a logger, extension, protocol, lists for known extensions and protocols, and others.
- The class has multiple constructors with varying parameters, allowing customization of extensions, protocols, and maximum frame size.
- The class overrides several methods from the `Draft` class, including methods for accepting handshakes as a server and client, processing frames, creating frames, and others.
- The class includes helper methods for generating a final key from an input string, creating byte arrays for specific lengths, and others.
- The class implements methods for creating and translating frames, handling different frame types, and processing the WebSocket handshake.
- The class provides methods to retrieve the current extension, protocol, and other draft-specific information.
- The class overrides the `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods for custom representation and comparison purposes.

Overall, the `Draft_6455` class provides a concrete implementation of the RFC 6455 WebSocket protocol, including handling handshakes, creating and parsing frames, and managing extensions and protocols.
