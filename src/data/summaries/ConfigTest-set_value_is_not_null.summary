0. Take note that in line 1, constructor `Config` from class `Config` is invoked.
1. In line 2, method `set` of class `Config` is invoked.
2. This is a method `set` inside the class `Config`. It takes two parameters: `key` and `value`, both of type `String`. The return type of the method is `void`, meaning it does not return any value.

Inside the method, the `normalize` method is called with the `key` parameter to convert it to a normalized form. Then, the `RealValue.fromString` method is called with the `value` parameter to convert it into a `RealValue` object.

Finally, the `setIn` method is called, passing the normalized key and the `RealValue` object as arguments. This method is likely responsible for saving the key-value pair in some data structure or configuration file.
3. Take note that in line 3, method `set` from class `Config` is invoked.
4. In line 1, an object of class `Config` is instantiated
5. This is a class called `Config` in the package `io.cucumber.pro.config`. Here is a summary of the class:

1. The class has two private instance variables: `valueByProperty` and `configByProperty`, both of type `Map<String, Value>`.
2. The `valueByProperty` map stores key-value pairs where the key is a `String` and the value is an instance of `Value`.
3. The `configByProperty` map stores key-value pairs where the key is a `String` and the value is an instance of `Config`.
4. The class has several public methods to get and set values based on a given key, such as `getString`, `getBoolean`, `getInteger`, `isNull`, `setNull`, `set`, and more.
5. The class also has utility methods to handle the internal operations, like `setValue`, `getChild`, `getValue`, `getIn`, `setIn`, `toYaml`, `print`, `indent`, `toPath`, and `normalize`.
6. The `normalize` method is responsible for converting a given key to a normalized form by replacing underscores with dots and converting it to lowercase.
7. There are also some exception handling and utility methods to handle printing and formatting YAML strings.

Overall, this class represents a hierarchical configuration with support for nested keys and different value types. It provides methods to get and set values, handle key normalization, and convert the configuration to a YAML string format.
