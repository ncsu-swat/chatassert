0. In line 1, method `convert` of class `FizzBuzzTDD` is invoked.
1. The given method `convert` is a static method of the class `FizzBuzzTDD`. It takes an argument `i` of the `int` data type.

In this method, the code first checks if `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, using the condition `0 == i % 15`. If this condition is true, it returns the string "FizzBuzz".

If the above condition is not true, the code checks if `i` is divisible by 5 using the condition `0 == i % 5`. If this condition is true, it returns the string "Buzz".

If the above two conditions are not true, the code checks if `i` is divisible by 3 using the condition `0 == i % 3`. If this condition is true, it returns the string "Fizz".

If none of the above conditions are true, it means that `i` is not divisible by either 3 or 5, so it returns the string representation of `i` using the concatenation with an empty string (i.e., `"" + i`).

Overall, this method converts a given integer `i` into a string based on the following rules:
- If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz".
- If `i` is divisible by 5, return "Buzz".
- If `i` is divisible by 3, return "Fizz".
- Otherwise, return the string representation of `i`.
2. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `String` is created.
