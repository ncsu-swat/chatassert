0. Take note that in line 2, constructor `RpcAddressParser` from class `RpcAddressParser` is invoked.
1. In line 3, method `parse` of class `RpcAddressParser` is invoked.
2. This is the code for the `parse` method in the `RpcAddressParser` class. Let me explain it step by step:

1. The method signature indicates that it overrides the `parse` method defined in the `RemotingAddressParser` interface.

2. The method starts by checking if the `url` parameter is blank. If it is blank, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.

3. Next, the method tries to get the parsed URL from a cache. If it exists, it is returned.

4. If the URL is not in the cache, the method proceeds to parse the URL.

5. The method initializes three variables: `ip`, `port`, and `properties` to `null`.

6. Then, it iterates over the characters of the URL string, searching for a colon (':') character, which separates the IP address from the port number.

7. If a colon is found, the characters before the colon are assigned to `ip`, and the method checks if the URL ends with a colon, which is not allowed. If it does, an exception is thrown.

8. Moving to the next part, the method iterates over the remaining characters of the URL, searching for a question mark ('?') character, which separates the port from any query parameters.

9. If a question mark is found, the characters between the previous position and the question mark are assigned to `port`, and the method checks if the URL ends with a question mark, which is not allowed. If it does, an exception is thrown.

10. If there are no more characters after the question mark, the method assigns the characters between the previous position and the end of the URL string to `port`.

11. If there are characters left in the URL string after parsing the port, the method initializes the `properties` variable and enters a loop to parse the remaining query parameters.

12. Within the loop, the method searches for an equality sign ('=') to separate the key and value of each query parameter.

13. If an equality sign is found, the characters between the previous position and the equality sign are assigned to `key`, and the method checks if the URL ends with an equality sign, which is not allowed. If it does, an exception is thrown.

14. After parsing the key, the method searches for an ampersand ('&') to separate the current query parameter from the next one.

15. If an ampersand is found, the characters between the previous position and the ampersand are assigned to `value`, and the method checks if the URL ends with an ampersand, which is not allowed. If it does, an exception is thrown.

16. If there are no more ampersands after parsing the value, the characters between the previous position and the end of the URL string are assigned to `value`.

17. The `key` and `value` pair are then added to the `properties` object.

18. After parsing all the query parameters, a new `Url` object is created with the original `url`, `ip`, `port`, and `properties`.

19. The method then calls `initUrlArgs` to initialize further arguments of the `Url` object.

20. The parsed `Url` object is stored in a cache (`parsedUrls`) using the original `url` as the key.

21. Finally, the parsed `Url` object is returned.

That's the explanation of the provided method code. Let me know if you have any further questions.
3. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `String` is created.
4. In line 2, an object of class `RpcAddressParser` is instantiated
5. Sure, let me explain the provided class code:

1. The class is named `RpcAddressParser` and it implements the `RemotingAddressParser` interface.

2. The class imports various other classes and interfaces from different packages that are required for its functionality.

3. The class starts with a few comments containing licensing information and version details.

4. The class defines methods to parse addresses and retrieve information from them, such as `parse`, `parseUniqueKey`, `parseProperty`, and `initUrlArgs`.

5. The `parse` method takes a URL as a parameter and parses it to extract the IP, port, and properties. It returns a `Url` object containing the parsed information.

6. The `parseUniqueKey` method takes a URL as a parameter and extracts the unique key from it. It returns the extracted unique key.

7. The `parseProperty` method takes an address and a property key and returns the property value associated with that key in the given address.

8. The `initUrlArgs` method initializes various arguments of the `Url` object, such as connection timeout, protocol, version, connection number, and connection warm-up.

9. The class also contains a private helper method, `tryGet`, which tries to retrieve a parsed URL from a cache.

10. Overall, the `RpcAddressParser` class provides functionality to parse and extract information from RPC addresses in a specific format.

That's the explanation of the provided class code. Let me know if you have any further questions.
6. In line 3, an object of class `Url` is instantiated
7. This is the code for the `Url` class. Let me explain its structure and the functionality provided by its methods:

1. The class is named `Url` and is located in the `com.alipay.remoting` package.

2. The class imports various classes and interfaces required for its functionality, such as `Configs`, `RpcProtocolV2`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`.

3. The class starts with comments containing licensing information, version details, and author information.

4. The class defines multiple instance variables, such as `originUrl`, `ip`, `port`, `uniqueKey`, `connectTimeout`, `protocol`, `version`, `connNum`, `connWarmup`, and `properties`. These variables represent different attributes of a URL.

5. The class provides multiple constructors to initialize the `Url` object with different combinations of parameters, such as `originUrl`, `ip`, `port`, `uniqueKey`, and `properties`.

6. The class includes getter and setter methods for the instance variables.

7. The class also includes the `getProperty` method, which returns the value of a property associated with a given key from the `properties` map.

8. Additionally, the class provides overridden methods for `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`.

9. The class defines a `ConcurrentHashMap` variable named `parsedUrls` to cache parsed URLs using their original URL as the key.

10. The class includes a static boolean variable named `isCollected`, which is used for unit testing purposes to indicate whether the object has been garbage collected or not.

11. The class defines a logger instance using the `BoltLoggerFactory`.

12. The class overrides the `finalize` method, which is called by the garbage collector when the object is being finalized. In this method, the `Url` object is removed from the `parsedUrls` cache.

13. Finally, the class includes getter and setter methods for the `version` instance variable.

That's the explanation of the provided `Url` class code. Let me know if you have any further questions.
