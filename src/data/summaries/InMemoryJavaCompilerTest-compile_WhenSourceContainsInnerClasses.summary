6. Take note that in line 7, method `toString` from class `StringBuffer` is invoked.
7. In line 7, method `newInstance` of class `InMemoryJavaCompiler` is invoked.
8. Certainly! 

The provided code snippet defines a method named `newInstance` inside the `InMemoryJavaCompiler` class. Here's a breakdown of what the method does:

- The method is declared as `public`, which means it can be accessed from anywhere.
- The return type of the method is `InMemoryJavaCompiler`, indicating that it returns an instance of the `InMemoryJavaCompiler` class.
- The method implementation consists of a single line: `return new InMemoryJavaCompiler();`.
- In this line, the `new` keyword is used to create a new object of the `InMemoryJavaCompiler` class.
- The created object is then returned as the result of the method.

Overall, this method provides a convenient way to create a new instance of the `InMemoryJavaCompiler` class. It can be called without any arguments and will return a freshly created instance of the class.
9. In line 7, method `compile` of class `InMemoryJavaCompiler` is invoked.
10. Certainly! Here's an explanation of the provided method code:

- The method is named `compile` and belongs to the class `InMemoryJavaCompiler`.
- It is declared as `public`, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere.
- The method takes two parameters:
  - `className` of type `String`, which represents the name of the class to be compiled.
  - `sourceCode` of type `String`, which represents the source code of the class to be compiled.
- The method has a return type of `Class<?>`, indicating that it returns a class object.
- The method may throw an `Exception` if any error occurs during the compilation process.

Inside the method, the following steps are performed:

1. The `addSource` method is invoked on the current instance of `InMemoryJavaCompiler` with the `className` and `sourceCode` as arguments. This method is assumed to add the given source code to the compiler.
2. The `compileAll` method is invoked on the current instance of `InMemoryJavaCompiler`. This method is assumed to compile all the added source codes.
3. Finally, the `get` method is invoked on the result of the `compileAll` method, passing `className` as the key. This method is assumed to retrieve the compiled class object corresponding to the specified class name.

The method then returns the compiled class object, which can be used for further operations or instantiation.

Overall, this method provides a convenient way to compile a single source code, given the class name and source code as input.
11. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `StringBuffer` is created.
12. Take note that in line 7, an object of class `Class` is created.
