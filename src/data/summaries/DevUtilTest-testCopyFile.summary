4. In line 3, method `copyFile` of class `DevUtil` is invoked.
5. The given code is a method named `copyFile` defined in the `DevUtil` class. Here is a summary of the method:

- The method takes four parameters:
  - `fileChanged`: the file that was changed and needs to be copied.
  - `srcDir`: the directory of the original file.
  - `targetDir`: the target directory where the file will be copied.
  - `targetFileName` (optional): if provided, renames the file to `targetFileName` in the target directory.
- The method throws an `IOException` if it is unable to resolve the canonical path.
- Inside the method:

  - It calls the `getTargetFile` method to determine the target resource file for the copying operation based on the original file, source directory, target directory, and target file name.
  - It attempts to copy the original file to the target resource file using the `FileUtils.copyFile` method.
  - If the copy is successful, it logs an info message stating the source file's canonical path and target file's canonical path.
  - If the copy fails due to a `FileNotFoundException`, it logs a debug message indicating that the file could not be copied.
  - If any other exception occurs during the copying process, it logs the exception with a debug message.

Overall, the `copyFile` method is responsible for copying a file from a source directory to a target directory, with an optional renaming feature.
