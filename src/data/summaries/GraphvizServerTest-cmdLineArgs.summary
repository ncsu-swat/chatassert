0. In line 1, method `parse` of class `GraphvizServer.CmdOptions` is invoked.
1. The `parse` method takes an array of `String` as input and returns an instance of the `CmdOptions` class. Here's a breakdown of the method code:

- On line 1, the method signature indicates that the method is static, belongs to the `CmdOptions` class, and returns a `CmdOptions` object. It takes an array of `String` arguments (`args`) as a parameter.

- On line 2, a new instance of `CmdOptions` is created and assigned to the `options` variable.

- From line 3 to line 27, there is a `for` loop that iterates through each element in the `args` array.

- Inside the loop, the code checks if the current array element (stored in `args[i]`) starts with a hyphen ("-"). If it does, it is considered an option.

- On line 6, the code checks if the length of the option is 1. If it is, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with the message "Illegal option -".
  
- On line 8, `name` variable is assigned the second character of the option (starts from index 1).

- On lines 12-19, the code checks the length of the option. If the length is greater than 2, it means the option has a value after it. The code retrieves the value by using `substring(2)`.

- If the length is not greater than 2, on line 15, the code checks if `i` is the last index of the `args` array. If it is, it sets the value to an empty string. Otherwise, it retrieves the value from the next element in the `args` array (located at index `i + 1`) and increments `i` by 1.

- On line 18, the `name` and `value` are added to the `opts` map of the `options` object using the `put` method.

- If the current element in the `args` array is not an option, the code goes into the `else` block on line 20. It adds the element to the `args` list of the `options` object.

- Once the `for` loop finishes iterating through all the elements in the `args` array, the `options` object is returned on line 28.
2. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `String` is created.
3. In line 1, an object of class `GraphvizServer` is instantiated
4. This is a class named `GraphvizServer` that provides functionality for starting and running a Graphviz server. Here's a breakdown of the class code:

- The class is marked as `final`, which means it cannot be subclassed.

- The `GraphvizServer` class is package-private and is not accessible outside of its package.

- On line 14, the class has a private constructor, indicating that instances of this class cannot be created.

- At line 18, the class defines a constant integer variable `DEFAULT_PORT` with a value of 10234.

- On line 22, there is a `private static final Logger` object `LOG` from the `slf4j` library used for logging.

- On line 24, there is a `private static final String` constant `ENGINE_PACKAGE` which holds the value "guru.nidi.graphviz.engine".

- The class includes some static methods for starting the server, handling command line arguments, and rendering a graph.

- On line 33, there is a `public static void start(List<GraphvizEngine> engines) throws IOException` method that starts the Graphviz server with a list of `GraphvizEngine` objects as input.

- On line 41, there is an overloaded `public static void start(List<GraphvizEngine> engines, int port) throws IOException` method that starts the Graphviz server with a list of `GraphvizEngine` objects and a specific port number as input.

- On line 48, there is a `public static void main(String... args) throws IOException` method that serves as the entry point for running the Graphviz server.

- Inside the `main` method, there is a call to the `CmdOptions.parse` method to parse the command line arguments.

- The `CmdOptions` class is a static inner class defined within the `GraphvizServer` class. It is responsible for parsing command line arguments and holding the options and arguments.

- The `GraphvizServer` class also includes private helper methods like `engineFromString` and `render` that are used within the `main` method for starting the server and rendering the graph.

Overall, this class provides the functionality for starting a Graphviz server, handling command line arguments, and processing graph rendering requests.
5. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `CmdOptions` is created.
