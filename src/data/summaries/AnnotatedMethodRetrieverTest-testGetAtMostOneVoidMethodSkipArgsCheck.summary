0. In line 1, an object of class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` is instantiated.
1. The constructor you provided is for the class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever`. 

The constructor takes two parameters: `clazz` and `annotationClazz`. 

In line 1, the constructor is defined with the `public` access modifier, indicating that it can be called from any other class. 

Inside the constructor, we can see two assignments.

On line 2, the parameter `clazz` is assigned to the instance variable `this.clazz`. The `checkNotNull` method is used to ensure that the value of `clazz` is not null. If `clazz` is null, an exception will be thrown with the message "clazz can't be null".

On line 3, the parameter `annotationClazz` is assigned to the instance variable `this.annotationClazz`. Similarly, the `checkNotNull` method is used to ensure that the value of `annotationClazz` is not null. If `annotationClazz` is null, an exception will be thrown with the message "annotationClazz can't be null".

In summary, this constructor initializes the `clazz` and `annotationClazz` instance variables based on the values passed in as parameters, ensuring that neither of them is null.
2. In line 1, method `withVoidReturnType` of class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` is invoked.
3. This method belongs to the class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` and is called `withVoidReturnType()`. 

The method has a return type of `AnnotatedMethodRetriever`, indicating that it returns an instance of the `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` class.

In line 1, the method is defined with the `public` access modifier, meaning it can be accessed from any other class. The method name, `withVoidReturnType`, suggests that it performs some operation related to retrieving methods with a void return type.

Inside the method, the `withReturnType` method is invoked on the current instance of `AnnotatedMethodRetriever`. 

The `withReturnType` method takes a parameter of type `Class<?>`, and in this case, it is passed `Void.TYPE` as an argument. 

`Void.TYPE` represents the `void` keyword in Java, which denotes a method that does not return any value. 

The `withReturnType` method is responsible for setting the desired return type of the methods we want to retrieve. 

Therefore, this `withVoidReturnType` method simply calls the `withReturnType` method with `Void.TYPE` as the argument and returns the resulting `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` instance.

In summary, invoking the `withVoidReturnType` method configures the `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` object to retrieve methods with a `void` return type.
4. In line 1, method `find` of class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` is invoked.
5. The `find()` method is defined in the class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` and has a return type of `Method`, indicating that it returns a `Method` object.

In this method, a local variable `methods` of type `List<Method>` is declared and assigned the result of invoking the `findAll()` method.

The `findAll()` method is not provided in the code you provided, but it can be inferred that it retrieves all the methods matching a specific criterion, based on the class and annotation specified when creating the `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` object.

After retrieving the methods, the code enters a `switch` statement based on the size of the `methods` list.

If the list is empty (size is 0), the `case 0` block is executed, and `null` is returned, indicating that no method was found.

If the list contains only one element (size is 1), the `case 1` block is executed. The `iterator().next()` method is called on the `methods` list, and it returns the single `Method` object in the list. This `Method` object is then returned.

If there are multiple elements in the list (size is greater than 1), the `default` block is executed. A `ReflectionException` is thrown with a message that includes the name of the class and the name of the annotation, indicating that there are too many methods with the specified annotation in the class.

In summary, the `find()` method retrieves a list of methods, checks the size of the list, and either returns a `Method` object, `null`, or throws an exception based on the number of methods found.
6. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `AnnotationTestClass` is created.
7. In line 1, an object of class `Prepare` is instantiated
8. This is the code for the `Prepare` annotation class. Annotations in Java are a form of metadata that can be added to classes, methods, or other program elements to provide additional information or instructions to the compiler and runtime.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The package statement specifies that this class belongs to the package `com.hazelcast.simulator.test.annotations`.

- The class is defined as `@interface`, indicating that it is an annotation type.

- The `Prepare` annotation is annotated with two other annotations: `@Retention` and `@Target`. These annotations specify the retention policy (runtime retention) and the target element (method) on which the `Prepare` annotation can be applied.

- The annotation has a single element `boolean global() default false;`. This element represents a boolean value, indicating whether the warmup process should be performed globally or per member in the cluster. It has a default value of `false`.

- A Javadoc comment is provided to explain the purpose and usage of the `Prepare` annotation. It states that the `Prepare` annotation is used to perform expensive setup operations, such as filling a map, before running tests. It also mentions the semantics of the `Prepare` methods' execution order and the fact that the prepare method(s) are called only once per test-instance.

In summary, the `Prepare` annotation is used to mark methods that perform expensive setup operations before running test cases. It provides the option to specify whether the warmup process should be performed globally or per member in the cluster.
9. In line 1, an object of class `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` is instantiated
10. The provided code is for the `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` class. This class is used to retrieve methods that are annotated with a specific annotation from a given class.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The class is defined within the package `com.hazelcast.simulator.utils`.

- The class imports various classes and static methods from different packages, such as `java.lang.reflect`, `com.hazelcast.simulator.utils.Preconditions`, and `java.lang.String`.

- The class starts with the declaration of instance variables `clazz`, `annotationClazz`, `returnType`, `mustBePublic`, `mustBeNotStatic`, `mustBeNoArg`, and `filter`. These variables are used to store information about the class, the annotation class, desired return type, method modifiers, and an optional filter.

- The class constructor takes in two parameters: `clazz` and `annotationClazz`. The constructor initializes the instance variables `clazz` and `annotationClazz` with the corresponding parameter values. It uses the `checkNotNull` method to ensure that neither of the parameters is null.

- The class provides various methods that allow customization of the method retrieval process. These methods include `withVoidReturnType()`, `withReturnType(Class returnType)`, `withPublicNonStaticModifier()`, `withoutArgs()`, and `withFilter(AnnotationFilter filter)`. These methods update the relevant instance variables and return an instance of `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` itself, allowing method chaining.

- The class provides two important methods: `find()` and `findAll()`. 

  - `find()` returns a single `Method` object that matches the specified criteria. This method uses the `findAll()` method internally to retrieve a list of methods and then checks the size of the list using a `switch` statement. If the size is 0, it returns null. If the size is 1, it returns the first (and only) element from the list. If the size is greater than 1, it throws a `ReflectionException`.

  - `findAll()` retrieves a list of methods from the specified class that are annotated with the specified annotation. It performs various checks on each method based on the current configuration (return type, modifiers, etc.) and adds the valid methods to the list. It also handles the case of overridden methods by checking and discarding duplicate methods.

- The class includes several private helper methods, such as `verifyArgs(Method method)`, `verifyReturnType(Method method)`, `verifyNotStatic(Method method)`, `verifyPublic(Method method)`, `findAllDeclaredMethods(Class classType)`, `findDeclaredMethods(Class searchClass, List<Method> methods)`, and `isOverridden(List<Method> subMethods, Method superMethod)`. These methods are used internally to perform different validations, retrieve declared methods, and determine if a method is overridden.

In summary, the `AnnotatedMethodRetriever` class provides a way to retrieve methods annotated with a specific annotation from a given class, allowing customization of various criteria such as return type, modifiers, and more.
11. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `Method` is created.
