0. In line 1, method `getAllEncodedTokens` of class `CharacterProtector` is invoked.
1. Certainly! The method `getAllEncodedTokens` is defined as part of the `CharacterProtector` class. Let's break down the code:

- The method is declared with a return type of `Collection<String>`, which means it will return a collection of string values.
- The method body consists of a single statement:
   - The `return` keyword is used to specify the result of the method.
   - The `Collections.unmodifiableSet` method is called, which takes a set and returns an unmodifiable (read-only) view of the set. In this case, the set passed as an argument is `unprotectMap.keySet()`.
   - `unprotectMap` refers to a map object that contains keys and values.
   - `keySet()` is a method of the map class that returns a set view of the keys contained in the map.

In summary, the `getAllEncodedTokens` method returns an unmodifiable collection of the keys from the `unprotectMap` map object.
2. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `Collection` is created.
