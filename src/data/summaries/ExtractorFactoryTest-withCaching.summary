0. In line 1, method `useCachedDownload` of class `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig.Builder` is invoked.
1. This method, `useCachedDownload`, is a method of the `Builder` class within the `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig` class. It takes in a boolean parameter `cacheDownload` which determines whether the artifact should be re-downloaded or not if it already exists in the filesystem.

Within the method, the `cacheDownload` field of the `Builder` object is assigned the value of the `cacheDownload` parameter. Then, `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object and a reference to the `Builder` object is returned. This allows method chaining and is a common practice in builder design patterns.

In summary, this method is used to set the `cacheDownload` field of the `Builder` class and returns a reference to the `Builder` object itself, allowing for method chaining.
2. In line 2, an object of class `ExtractorFactory` is instantiated.
3. Certainly! This is a constructor for the `ExtractorFactory` class. It takes a single parameter, `config`, of type `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig`. 

Inside the constructor, `this.config` is used to refer to the instance variable `config` of the current object (`ExtractorFactory`). The value of the `config` parameter is then assigned to the instance variable `this.config`, effectively initializing it with the provided `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig` object.

In summary, this constructor is used to create an instance of the `ExtractorFactory` class and initialize its `config` variable with the provided `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig` object.
4. In line 2, method `build` of class `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig.Builder` is invoked.
5. Certainly! The provided code snippet is a method named `build()` within the `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig.Builder` class. This method is used to construct an immutable instance of `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the method code:

1. If the `artifactRepository` field is null, it is set to the `OfficialArtifactRepository.GITHUB` value. This provides a default artifact repository if none is specified.

2. The operating system is detected using the `detect()` method from the `OperatingSystem` class.

3. If the `version` field is null, it is set to `PredefinedVersion.LATEST`, which provides a default version.

4. The `downloadSource` variable is assigned the URL of the artifact to download based on the configured `artifactRepository`, `version`, and detected operating system.

5. If the `downloadTarget` field is null, a filename is derived from the `downloadSource` URL and a new `File` object is created in the `downloadFolder`.

6. If the `extractionFolder` field is null, a new `File` object is created using the system's temporary directory.

7. The absolute file path to the RabbitMQ application within the `extractionFolder` is created and assigned to the `appAbsPath` variable.

8. An instance of `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig` is created using the initialized fields and values, along with other provided parameters.

9. The newly created `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig` instance is returned by the `build()` method.

In summary, the `build()` method constructs an immutable `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig` object using default and provided values for various properties, including the download source, target, extraction folder, and other configurable options.
6. In line 2, method `getNewInstance` of class `ExtractorFactory` is invoked.
7. Certainly! The provided code is for a method named `getNewInstance()` within the `ExtractorFactory` class. This method is responsible for creating and returning an instance of the `Extractor` interface based on the provided configuration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. An initial `Extractor` instance named `extractor` is created using the `BasicExtractor` class constructor, passing in the `config` object as a parameter.

2. The `shouldCachedDownload()` method is invoked on the `config` object to check whether cached download is enabled. If it returns `true`, indicating that cached download is enabled, a new instance of the `CachedExtractor` class is created. This constructor takes two parameters: the `extractor` instance created in the previous step and the `config` object. The `extractor` variable is reassigned to this new instance.

3. Finally, the `extractor` instance, which could either be a `BasicExtractor` or a `CachedExtractor` based on the configuration, is returned by the method.

In summary, the `getNewInstance()` method returns an instance of the `Extractor` interface based on the provided configuration. If cached download is enabled, it wraps the `BasicExtractor` with a `CachedExtractor`, otherwise it returns the original `BasicExtractor` instance.
8. In line 2, an object of class `ExtractorFactory` is instantiated
9. Certainly! The provided code snippet is the definition of the `ExtractorFactory` class. This class is responsible for creating instances of the `Extractor` interface based on the provided configuration. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is defined within the package `io.arivera.oss.embedded.rabbitmq.extract`.

2. The `ExtractorFactory` class has a private instance variable `config` of type `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig`. This variable holds the configuration object used to create the `Extractor` instances.

3. The class has a constructor `ExtractorFactory(EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig config)`, which takes a single parameter of type `EmbeddedRabbitMqConfig`. This constructor initializes the `config` instance variable with the provided configuration object.

4. The class has a method `getNewInstance()` that returns an instance of the `Extractor` interface based on the provided configuration. This method follows these steps:
   
   a. It creates an instance of `BasicExtractor`, passing the `config` object as a parameter, and assigns it to the `extractor` variable.
   
   b. It checks if the `shouldCachedDownload()` method of the `config` object returns `true`. If it does, indicating that cached download is enabled, it creates an instance of `CachedExtractor`, passing the `extractor` and `config` objects as parameters. The `extractor` variable is reassigned to this new instance.
   
   c. Finally, it returns the `extractor` instance, which could be a `BasicExtractor` or a `CachedExtractor` based on the configuration.

In summary, the `ExtractorFactory` class is responsible for creating and providing instances of the `Extractor` interface based on the provided configuration. It encapsulates the logic of choosing between `BasicExtractor` and `CachedExtractor` depending on the given configuration.
10. In line 2, an object of class `Extractor` is instantiated
11. Certainly! The provided code snippet defines an interface named `Extractor` within the `io.arivera.oss.embedded.rabbitmq.extract` package. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `Extractor` interface extends the `Runnable` interface. This means that any class implementing `Extractor` must also implement the `run()` method from the `Runnable` interface.
- The `run()` method is declared in the `Extractor` interface. It throws an `ExtractionException`. Any class implementing `Extractor` must provide an implementation for this method.
- The `Extractor` interface also contains an abstract class named `Decorator`. This class acts as a decorator for other `Extractor` instances.
- The `Decorator` class extends the `Extractor` interface, which means it must implement the `run()` method defined in `Extractor`.
- The `Decorator` class has a constructor that takes an `Extractor` object as a parameter. This constructor initializes the `innerExtractor` instance variable with the provided `Extractor` object.
- The `Decorator` class is not abstract, which means it can be instantiated directly. However, since it is an abstract class itself, it cannot be instantiated without subclassing it and providing an implementation for the `run()` method.

In summary, the `Extractor` interface defines the contract for classes that can perform extraction operations. It requires the implementation of the `run()` method and includes an abstract `Decorator` class that can be used to decorate other `Extractor` instances with additional functionality.
