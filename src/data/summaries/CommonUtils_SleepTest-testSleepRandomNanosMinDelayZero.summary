0. Take note that in line 1, method `nanoTime` from class `System` is invoked.
1. Take note that in line 2, constructor `Random` from class `Random` is invoked.
2. In line 2, method `sleepRandomNanos` of class `CommonUtils` is invoked.
3. This method `sleepRandomNanos` is a static method defined in the `CommonUtils` class. It takes two parameters: a `Random` object named `random` and a `maxDelayNanos` of type `long`.

The purpose of this method is to sleep for a random amount of time, with the maximum delay specified by `maxDelayNanos`.

The method starts by checking if `maxDelayNanos` is less than or equal to zero. If it is, the method returns immediately and does nothing.

Next, it generates a random positive `long` value by invoking the `nextLong` method of the `random` object, then adding 1 and taking the absolute value using `Math.abs`.

Finally, it selects a random duration within the maximum delay range by taking the modulo of the random value with `maxDelayNanos`. This ensures that the sleep duration will be a non-negative value less than `maxDelayNanos`.

The method `sleepNanos` is assumed to be defined elsewhere and is responsible for putting the current thread to sleep for the specified duration in nanoseconds.
