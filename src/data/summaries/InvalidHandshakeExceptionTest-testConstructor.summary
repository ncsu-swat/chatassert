0. In line 1, an object of class `InvalidHandshakeException` is instantiated.
1. Certainly! 

The code you provided is a constructor for the `InvalidHandshakeException` class. Constructors are special methods that are called when an object of a class is created.

Let's break down the constructor code step by step:

1. The constructor is declared with the same name as the class (`InvalidHandshakeException`) and has no parameters. This means that when this constructor is called, it will create an object of `InvalidHandshakeException` without any arguments.

2. The constructor contains a comment that describes its purpose. In this case, it states that the constructor is for creating an `InvalidHandshakeException`.

3. The constructor calls the `super()` method. The `super()` keyword is used to call the constructor of the superclass, which is `InvalidDataException` in this case. This means that before the constructor code is executed, the constructor of `InvalidDataException` is invoked.

4. Inside the `super()` method, there is an argument `CloseFrame.PROTOCOL_ERROR`. It passes the `PROTOCOL_ERROR` constant from the `CloseFrame` class to the constructor of `InvalidDataException`. The purpose of passing this argument is to specify the `closecode` of the exception. This indicates that the exception is caused by a protocol error.

So, when you instantiate an object of `InvalidHandshakeException` using this constructor, it will call the constructor of `InvalidDataException` with `CloseFrame.PROTOCOL_ERROR` as the argument, setting the `closecode` for the exception.
