0. In line 2, an object of class `CEFParser` is instantiated.
1. The code snippet you provided is a constructor method for the class `CEFParser`. 

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize the newly created object of that class. In this case, the constructor is named `CEFParser` which means it has the same name as the class itself. 

The constructor code does not take any parameters, as there are no input arguments enclosed within the parentheses `()`. 

Inside the constructor, there is a comment that serves as documentation. It states that this particular constructor creates an instance of the `CEFParser` class and utilizes the default Bean Validator. The details of the Bean Validator are not shown in the given code snippet.

In summary, this constructor is used to create a new `CEFParser` object and sets it up with the default Bean Validator.
2. In line 3, method `parse` of class `CEFParser` is invoked.
3. The code snippet you provided is a method definition for the `parse` method within the `CEFParser` class.

This method is a public method, which means it can be accessed from outside the class. It accepts two parameters:
1. `cefString`, which is a `String` parameter containing the CEF message to be parsed.
2. `validate`, which is a `boolean` parameter indicating whether the parser should validate values beyond type compatibility.

The method has a return type of `CommonEvent`, which means it is expected to return an object of the `CommonEvent` class.

The method is also annotated with JavaDoc comments, which provide additional information and documentation for the method. The comments state that this method converts a CEF formatted string into a `CommonEvent` object, with the ability to control strict validation. It mentions that this method uses the `Locale.ENGLISH` for processing CEF extension fields containing dates.

The actual implementation of the `parse` method is not shown in the given code snippet. However, it can be inferred that the method delegates the actual parsing logic to another overloaded version of the `parse` method within the same class. This overloaded version of the method would take an additional `Locale` parameter and likely contains the parsing logic.

In summary, this method is used to parse a CEF formatted string into a `CommonEvent` object, with control over strict validation and using the `Locale.ENGLISH` for processing dates. The actual parsing logic might be implemented in an overloaded version of this method.
4. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `String` is created.

6. The given code snippet is the definition of the `CEFParser` class. Here is a summary of the important aspects:

- The class is located in the package `com.fluenda.parcefone.parser`.
- The class has import statements for various classes and interfaces used within the code.
- The class declaration starts with comments defining the licensing and basic information.
- The class contains a logger named `logger` from the SLF4J logging library.
- The class contains a static pattern called `extensionPattern` used for finding extension fields in a CEF message.
- The class has an instance variable `validator` of type `Validator` to perform validation on parsed CEF messages.
- The class provides multiple overloaded constructors, including one with no parameters and one that accepts a `validator` object.
- The class provides several public methods for parsing CEF messages, taking different combinations of input parameters such as CEF strings, byte arrays, validation flags, and locale.
- The `parse` methods parse the CEF message into a `CommonEvent` object, split it into headers and extensions, and store them in appropriate data structures.
- The `parse` methods perform validation on the parsed CEF message if the `validate` flag is set and a `validator` object is available.
- If validation fails, the `parse` methods return `null`; otherwise, they return the parsed `CommonEvent` object.
- If no validation is requested, the methods simply return the parsed `CommonEvent` object.
- The class uses the `logger` to log error messages in case of any exceptions or validation failures.

In summary, the `CEFParser` class provides methods to parse CEF messages into `CommonEvent` objects with the ability to perform validation and handle different input formats.
7. In line 3, an object of class `CommonEvent` is instantiated
8. The provided code snippet is the definition of the `CommonEvent` abstract class. Here is a summary of its important aspects:

- The class is located in the package `com.fluenda.parcefone.event`.
- The class has import statements for relevant classes and exceptions used within the code.
- The class is abstract, denoted by the `abstract` keyword. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, but can be extended by other classes.
- The class contains JavaDoc comments that provide information about its purpose. It states that it implements a class similar to a struct, storing headers and extension fields defined in the Common Event Format.
- The class declares several abstract methods, which means they must be implemented by concrete subclasses:
  - `setHeader`: Sets the headers of the CEF event using a map of keys and values.
  - `setExtension`: Sets the extension fields of the CEF event using a map of keys and values.
  - `setExtension` (overloaded): Sets the extension fields of the CEF event using a map of keys and values, with an additional flag to allow null values.
  - `getHeader`: Retrieves the headers of the CEF event as a map of keys and values.
  - `getExtension`: Retrieves the extension fields of the CEF event as a map of keys and values, with an option to include only populated fields.
  - `getExtension` (overloaded): Retrieves the extension fields of the CEF event as a map of keys and values, with options to include only populated fields and custom extensions.
- The methods may throw a `CEFHandlingException` when they encounter issues during their operations.
- Each method is declared as abstract, without any implementation. The implementation specific to each concrete subclass should override these methods.
- The class does not have any instance variables or constructors, as it is meant to be extended for specific use cases.

In summary, the `CommonEvent` abstract class serves as a blueprint for classes that handle Common Event Format (CEF) events. It defines methods for setting and retrieving headers and extension fields of CEF events, taking advantage of map-based data structures. Concrete subclasses of `CommonEvent` are expected to provide implementation details for these abstract methods.
