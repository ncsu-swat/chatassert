0. Take note that in line 2, constructor `URI` from class `URI` is invoked.
1. In line 2, an object of class `WebSocketClient` is instantiated.
2. Certainly! 

The provided code snippet represents a constructor for the `WebSocketClient` class. Let's break it down step by step:

- The constructor is declared with the same name as the class, `WebSocketClient`.
- It takes two parameters: 
  - `serverUri` of type `URI`, which represents the server URI to connect to.
  - `httpHeaders` of type `Map<String, String>`, which represents additional HTTP headers.
- The constructor is marked with the `@since` annotation, indicating that it was introduced in version 1.3.8 of the API.

Now let's take a look at the body of the constructor:

- It starts by invoking another constructor of the same class using the keyword `this`.
- The invoked constructor accepts three parameters:
  - `serverUri`, which is passed along from the current constructor.
  - `new Draft_6455()`, which creates a new instance of the `Draft_6455` class. This is used to specify the WebSocket draft version.
  - `httpHeaders`, which is also passed along from the current constructor.

In summary, this constructor initializes a `WebSocketClient` instance with a server URI and additional HTTP headers. It sets the default WebSocket draft version as `Draft_6455`. The connection to the server is not established automatically, and the `connect()` method needs to be called explicitly.
3. In line 7, method `addHeader` of class `WebSocketClient` is invoked.
4. Certainly! The provided code snippet represents the `addHeader` method of the `WebSocketClient` class. Let's break down each part of the code:

- The method is documented using JavaDoc comments, which provide information about the method's parameters, return types, and any additional details. In this case, the documentation explains the purpose of the method and its behavior.
- The method takes two parameters:
  - `key` of type `String`, which represents the name of the header to add.
  - `value` of type `String`, which represents the value of the header to add.
- The method is marked with the `@since` annotation, indicating that it was introduced in version 1.4.1 of the API.
- Inside the method, it first checks if the `headers` variable is `null`. 
- If `headers` is indeed `null`, it creates a new `TreeMap` instance called `headers` that uses `String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER` as the comparator. This ensures that the headers are case-insensitive.
- It then adds the new header to the `headers` map by calling the `put` method, using `key` as the key and `value` as the value.
- If a header with the same key already exists in the `headers` map, it will be overridden by the new value.

In summary, the `addHeader` method allows you to add additional headers to be sent during the handshake process for the WebSocket connection. If the connection has already been established, adding headers will have no effect unless the `reconnect` method is called. If a header with the same key already exists, it will be updated with the new value.
5. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `String` is created.
6. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `Map` is created.
7. In line 2, an object of class `ServerHandshake` is instantiated
8. Certainly! Let's break down the provided class code:

- The code represents the `ServerHandshake` interface, which extends the `Handshakedata` interface. It is part of the `org.java_websocket.handshake` package.
- The class is documented using multi-line comments, which provide copyright and licensing information for the software.
- The interface does not define any fields or variables.
- It declares two methods, `getHttpStatus()` and `getHttpStatusMessage()`, without providing any implementation details. These methods serve as a contract that any implementation of this interface should adhere to when interacting with a server during the handshake process.
- The `getHttpStatus()` method returns a `short` value representing the HTTP status code.
- The `getHttpStatusMessage()` method returns a `String` representing the HTTP status message.

In summary, this code represents the `ServerHandshake` interface, which defines methods related to retrieving the HTTP status code and message during the handshake process with a server. The actual implementation of these methods will be done in classes that implement this interface.
9. Take note that in line 2, an object of class `String` is created.
10. Take note that in line 2, an object of class `URI` is created.
11. In line 2, an object of class `WebSocketClient` is instantiated
12. The provided code represents the `WebSocketClient` class, which is a subclass of `AbstractWebSocket` and implements the `Runnable` and `WebSocket` interfaces. Let's go through the important details of this class:

- The class is documented using multi-line comments, which provide copyright and licensing information for the software.
- It belongs to the `org.java_websocket.client` package.
- The class extends `AbstractWebSocket` and implements the `Runnable` and `WebSocket` interfaces.
- It uses various import statements to import necessary classes and interfaces.
- The class defines multiple private and protected member variables, such as `uri`, `engine`, `socket`, `ostream`, `proxy`, `writeThread`, `connectReadThread`, `draft`, `headers`, etc.
- It also defines some constants and static variables.
- Then, it defines multiple constructors to initialize the `WebSocketClient` instance with various parameters like `serverUri`, `protocolDraft`, `httpHeaders`, and `connectTimeout`.
- The class provides various public methods to perform operations like connecting to a WebSocket server, reconnecting, sending messages, closing the connection, handling events, etc.
- Additionally, there are some private and protected methods that handle socket creation, SSL setup, handshake sending, reading, writing, error handling, etc.
- The class also overrides methods inherited from the `AbstractWebSocket` class and provides its own implementation for handling various WebSocket events.
- Lastly, there are abstract callback methods that must be implemented by subclasses of `WebSocketClient` to handle specific events like opening, closing, receiving messages, and errors.

In summary, the `WebSocketClient` class represents a client for establishing and managing WebSocket connections. It provides methods and callbacks to interact with the server and handle different events related to the WebSocket connection.
