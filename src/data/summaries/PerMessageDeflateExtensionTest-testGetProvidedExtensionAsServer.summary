0. Take note that in line 1, constructor `PerMessageDeflateExtension` from class `PerMessageDeflateExtension` is invoked.
1. In line 1, an object of class `PerMessageDeflateExtension` is instantiated
2. The given class is named `PerMessageDeflateExtension` and it extends the `CompressionExtension` class. It is a Java class that implements the functionality of the "permessage-deflate" extension as specified in the RFC 7692.

Here is a summary of the class:

- The class is located in the package `org.java_websocket.extensions.permessage_deflate`.
- It imports various classes and interfaces from different packages.
- The class starts with a block comment that provides information about the extension and its specification in the RFC 7692.
- The class defines various constants, such as the extension name and parameter names, the maximum window bits, tail bytes, and buffer size.
- It also defines instance variables such as `serverNoContextTakeover`, `clientNoContextTakeover`, `requestedParameters`, `inflater`, and `deflater`.
- The class includes getters and setters for `serverNoContextTakeover` and `clientNoContextTakeover`.
- The class overrides methods from the `CompressionExtension` class to handle frame encoding and decoding, the validation of frames, and extension negotiation.
- The `decodeFrame` method decompresses the payload of a given input frame using the DEFLATE algorithm and sets the frame's payload with the decompressed data.
- The `encodeFrame` method compresses the payload of a given input frame and sets the frame's payload with the compressed data.
- The class provides methods to check if a provided extension is accepted by the server or the client, and to generate the extension strings for the server and the client.
- The class includes a private method `endsWithTail` that checks if a byte array ends with the tail bytes.
- Lastly, the class provides a copy instance method and overrides `isFrameValid` and `toString` methods.

Overall, the `PerMessageDeflateExtension` class provides the implementation for handling the compression and decompression of frames using the permessage-deflate extension in Java.
