3. The code you provided is a class called `DefaultExtension` which implements the `IExtension` interface. It represents a normal implementation of the WebSocket protocol specified by rfc6455.

Here is a summary of the class:

- The class is located in the package `org.java_websocket.extensions` and is protected under the MIT license.
- It has no instance variables.
- The class overrides several methods defined in the `IExtension` interface.

The overridden methods are:

1. `decodeFrame(Framedata inputFrame) throws InvalidDataException`: This method decodes the frame data received from the WebSocket connection. In this implementation, it does nothing.

2. `encodeFrame(Framedata inputFrame)`: This method encodes the frame data to be sent over the WebSocket connection. In this implementation, it does nothing.

3. `acceptProvidedExtensionAsServer(String inputExtension)`: This method determines whether the server accepts the provided extension. In this implementation, it always returns true.

4. `acceptProvidedExtensionAsClient(String inputExtension)`: This method determines whether the client accepts the provided extension. In this implementation, it always returns true.

5. `isFrameValid(Framedata inputFrame) throws InvalidDataException`: This method checks if the received frame is valid according to the WebSocket protocol. If the frame has reserved bits set (RSV1, RSV2, or RSV3), it throws an `InvalidFrameException`.

6. `getProvidedExtensionAsClient()`: This method returns the extension provided by the client. In this implementation, it returns an empty string.

7. `getProvidedExtensionAsServer()`: This method returns the extension provided by the server. In this implementation, it returns an empty string.

8. `copyInstance()`: This method creates and returns a copy of the `DefaultExtension` instance.

9. `reset()`: This method resets the extension to its initial state. In this implementation, it does nothing.

10. `toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the class name.

11. `hashCode()`: This method returns the hash code of the class.

12. `equals(Object o)`: This method checks if the given object is equal to the instance of `DefaultExtension`. It returns true if the objects are the same or if the given object is not null and has the same class type as `DefaultExtension`.

Overall, this class represents a basic implementation of the WebSocket extension, providing empty or default behavior for the defined extension methods.
4. Take note that in line 2, an object of class `DefaultExtension` is created.
