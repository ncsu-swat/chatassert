1. This is a constructor method for the `XsdParser` class. It takes in a `String` parameter called `filePath`, which represents the path of the XSD file to be parsed.

The constructor calls the `parse` method, passing in the `filePath` as an argument. This method is responsible for parsing the XSD file and any subsequent XSD files referenced in `xsd:import` and `xsd:include` tags.

After parsing all the XSD files, the constructor resolves any references present in the XSD language, which are represented by the `ref` attribute.

Once the parsing and reference resolution is complete, the parse results and any remaining unsolved references can be accessed using the methods `getResultXsdSchemas()`, `getResultXsdElements()`, and `getUnsolvedReferences()` provided by the `XsdParser` class.

In summary, this constructor initializes an `XsdParser` object and parses an XSD file, along with any referenced files, resolving the references and providing access to the parse results and unsolved references.
2. In line 1, method `getFilePath` of class `IssuesTest` is invoked.
3. The method `getFilePath` is a private and static method of the `IssuesTest` class. It takes a `String` parameter called `fileName`, representing the name of the file for which the file path needs to be obtained.

Inside the method, the `getResource` method of the `ClassLoader` is called to obtain the URL of the resource corresponding to the `fileName`. The `getClassLoader()` method is invoked on the `HtmlParseTest` class to get the `ClassLoader` instance.

If the `resource` is not `null`, it means that the resource with the given `fileName` exists. In this case, the method returns the path of the resource using the `getPath` method of the `URL` class.

If the `resource` is `null`, it means that the resource with the given `fileName` is missing. In this case, the method throws a `RuntimeException` with an appropriate error message indicating that the file is missing.

In summary, this method is used to obtain the file path of a resource file based on its name. It utilizes the `getResource` method of the `ClassLoader` and returns the path if the resource is found, or throws an exception if the resource is missing.
4. Take note that in line 2, method `toList` from class `Collectors` is invoked.
5. In line 2, method `getResultXsdSchemas` of class `XsdParserCore` is invoked.
6. The method `getResultXsdSchemas` is a public method of the `XsdParserCore` class. It returns a stream of `XsdSchema` elements that have been parsed by the `XsdParserCore` class.

Inside the method, the `parseElements` field is accessed, which is a `Map` containing the parsed elements of the XSD file. The `values()` method is called on the `parseElements` map to get a collection of the parsed elements.

A stream is created from this collection using the `stream()` method. 

The `flatMap` operation is used to flatten the nested lists of parsed elements. It takes a lambda expression `List::stream` which converts each list of elements into a stream of elements.

The `filter` operation is applied to the stream, using a lambda expression `element -> element.getElement() instanceof XsdSchema`. It allows only those elements whose underlying element is an instance of `XsdSchema` to pass through.

The `map` operation is applied to the resulting stream of filtered elements. It uses a lambda expression `element -> (XsdSchema) element.getElement()` to extract and cast each element to `XsdSchema`.

Finally, the resulting stream of `XsdSchema` instances is returned.

In summary, this method retrieves and returns a stream of `XsdSchema` elements parsed by the `XsdParserCore` class.
7. Take note that in line 2, method `collect` from class `Stream` is invoked.

9. The provided code represents the class `XsdParser` from the `org.xmlet.xsdparser.core` package. This class is the core class of the XsdParser project.

Here's a summary of the important parts of the code:

- The class imports several classes from different packages, including `org.w3c.dom` and `org.xmlet.xsdparser`.

- The class extends the class `XsdParserCore`, which indicates that it inherits and extends functionality from the `XsdParserCore` class.

- The class contains two constructors. Both constructors take a `String` parameter `filePath`, representing the path of the XSD file to be parsed. The first constructor calls the `parse` method with the `filePath` as an argument, while the second constructor also takes a `ParserConfig` parameter `config` and updates the parser configuration by calling the `updateConfig` method of the superclass before calling the `parse` method.

- The class includes a private method named `parse` that takes a `String` parameter `filePath`. This method adds the `filePath` to the `schemaLocations` list, iterates over the `schemaLocations` list, and calls the `parseFile` method for each schema location. After parsing all the XSD files, it calls the `resolveRefs` method to resolve any references present in the XSD language.

- The private method `parseFile` takes a `String` parameter `filePath` and parses the XSD file and its containing XSD elements. It uses the DOM (Document Object Model) to retrieve a list of nodes from the XSD file. It then iterates over the nodes and parses the supported ones using the configured mappers. Finally, it sets the file path of the parsed schema and handles any exceptions that may occur during parsing.

- The private method `getSchemaNode` takes a `String` parameter `filePath` and uses the DOM to obtain a list of nodes from the XSD file. It normalizes the document, retrieves the child nodes, and searches for the `xsd:schema` node. If the node is found, it is returned. Otherwise, a `ParsingException` is thrown.

Overall, the `XsdParser` class serves as the core class for parsing XSD files and their contained elements. It provides constructors for parsing XSD files and methods for parsing and resolving references.

11. The provided code represents the class `XsdSchema` from the `org.xmlet.xsdparser.xsdelements` package. This class represents the XSD schema element in the XSD document.

Here's a summary of the important parts of the code:

- The class imports several classes from different packages, including `org.xmlet.xsdparser.core`, `org.xmlet.xsdparser.core.utils`, and `org.xmlet.xsdparser.xsdelements.elementswrapper`.

- The class extends the class `XsdAnnotatedElements`, which indicates that it inherits and extends functionality from the `XsdAnnotatedElements` class.

- The class contains several constant fields representing different tags that can be used to identify the `XsdSchema` element in the XSD document.

- The class contains several instance variables that represent different attributes and elements of the `XsdSchema` element. These variables include `attributeFormDefault`, `elementFormDefault`, `blockDefault`, `finalDefault`, `targetNamespace`, `version`, `xmlns`, `filePath`, `namespaces`, and `elements`.

- The class has a private constructor that takes several parameters, including a `XsdParserCore` instance, a map of attribute names and values, and a function that creates a visitor for the `XsdAbstractElement`.

- The class implements several methods, including `getVisitor()`, `getXsdElements()`, `getElements()`, `parse()`, `updatePrefixLocations()`, and several `add()` methods for adding different elements to the `XsdSchema`.

- The class also provides accessor methods for retrieving the values of different attributes and for getting the children elements of specific types.

- The class includes a method `resolveNamespace()` for resolving the specified namespace and schema location.

- The class includes getter and setter methods for the `namespaces` and `filePath` instance variables.

In summary, the `XsdSchema` class represents the XSD schema element in the XSD document. It provides methods to access and manipulate the attributes and children elements of the schema element.
12. Take note that in line 2, an object of class `List` is created.
