0. In line 1, an object of class `ODocument` is instantiated.
1. This is a constructor for the `ODocument` class in Java. Constructors are special methods in a class that are used to instantiate objects of that class.

In this constructor, no parameters are passed. It is marked with the `public` access modifier, meaning it can be accessed from any other class.

The comment `Internal constructor used on unmarshalling` gives a brief description of the purpose of this constructor.

Inside the constructor, there is a method called `setup()`. It is a method of the `ODocument` class that is called to perform any necessary setup or initialization for the object being created.

So, when an object of the `ODocument` class is instantiated using this constructor, the `setup()` method will be automatically called to set up the object.
2. In line 2, method `field` of class `ODocument` is invoked.
3. This is the definition of the `field` method in the `ODocument` class.

The method is marked with the `public` access modifier, indicating that it can be accessed from any other class.

The method takes two parameters:
- `iFieldName` of type `String`, which represents the name of the field being written. If the field name contains dots (`.`), it means the change is applied to nested documents in chain.
- `iPropertyValue` of type `Object`, which represents the value of the field being written.

The method returns an instance of the `ODocument` class, which allows for a fluent interface where multiple methods can be called in a chain.

The method implementation internally calls another method called `field` with three parameters. The third parameter is an array of types, but it is not relevant to understanding the overall functionality of the `field` method.

The purpose of the `field` method is to write the value of a field in the document. It sets the current document as dirty, which means that it marks the document as modified and in need of persistence.

So, when this `field` method is invoked on an `ODocument` object, it writes the specified field value and marks the document as dirty.
4. Take note that in line 3, constructor `ArrayList` from class `ArrayList` is invoked.
5. Take note that in line 4, constructor `ODocument` from class `ODocument` is invoked.
6. Take note that in line 5, method `add` from class `List` is invoked.
7. Take note that in line 6, method `field` from class `ODocument` is invoked.
8. In line 7, method `removeField` of class `ODocument` is invoked.
9. This is the code for the `removeField` method in the `ODocument` class.

The method is marked with the `public` access modifier, indicating that it can be accessed from any other class.

The method takes one parameter:
- `iFieldName` of type `String`, represents the name of the field to be removed from the document.

The method returns an `Object`, which is the value of the field that was removed.

The method begins by calling two helper methods, `checkForLoading` and `checkForFields`, which are not shown in the code snippet. These methods perform some checks and ensure that the document is loaded and has fields available before proceeding.

Next, the method checks if the `iFieldName` is equal to `"@class"` or `"@rid"`, which are special fields used by the document. If so, the method sets the corresponding values to `null` or a new instance of `ORecordId`.

Then, the method retrieves the entry for the field from the `_fields` map. If the entry is `null`, it means the field does not exist in the document, so the method returns `null`.

If the entry exists and change tracking is enabled (`_trackingChanges`), the original value of the field is saved in the entry's `original` field, the current value is set to `null`, and the entry is marked as changed.

Otherwise, if change tracking is not enabled, the entry is removed from the `_fields` map.

After that, the method decrements the `_fieldSize` counter and performs some cleanup operations, like removing listeners and untracking the old value if it is an `OIdentifiable` or setting the owner to `null` if it is an `ORidBag`.

Finally, the method marks the document as dirty and returns the old value of the field that was removed.
10. Take note that in line 8, constructor `HashSet` from class `HashSet` is invoked.
11. Take note that in line 9, constructor `ODocument` from class `ODocument` is invoked.
12. Take note that in line 10, method `add` from class `Set` is invoked.
13. Take note that in line 11, method `field` from class `ODocument` is invoked.
14. Take note that in line 12, method `removeField` from class `ODocument` is invoked.
15. In line 13, method `convertAllMultiValuesToTrackedVersions` of class `ODocumentInternal` is invoked.
16. This is the definition of the `convertAllMultiValuesToTrackedVersions` method in the `ODocumentInternal` class.

The method is marked with the `public` access modifier, indicating that it can be accessed from any other class.

The method takes one parameter, `document`, of type `ODocument`, representing the document on which the method is invoked.

The purpose of this method is to convert all the multi-value fields in the given `ODocument` to tracked versions. In other words, it enables change tracking for multi-value fields in the document.

The implementation of this method simply calls the `convertAllMultiValuesToTrackedVersions` method on the `document` object.

So, when this method is invoked on an `ODocument` object, it triggers the conversion of all multi-value fields in the document to tracked versions.
17. In line 14, method `getDirtyManager` of class `ORecordInternal` is invoked.
18. This is the definition of the `getDirtyManager` method in the `ORecordInternal` class.

The method is marked with the `public static` access modifiers, indicating that it can be accessed directly from other classes without needing an instance of the class.

The method takes one parameter, `record`, of type `ORecord`, representing the record for which the dirty manager is retrieved.

The purpose of this method is to retrieve the dirty manager associated with a given record. A dirty manager is responsible for tracking the changes made to a record and managing the state of the record.

The implementation of this method first checks if the `record` object is an instance of the `ORecordAbstract` class. If it is not, it calls the `getRecord` method on the `record` object to retrieve the underlying concrete implementation of the record.

Then, it casts the `record` object to the `ORecordAbstract` class, which is the abstract base class for concrete record implementations in OrientDB.

Finally, it calls the `getDirtyManager` method on the `ORecordAbstract` object to obtain the dirty manager associated with the record.

The method then returns the dirty manager.

So, when this method is invoked with a record object, it ensures that the record is an instance of `ORecordAbstract` (if not, it retrieves the concrete implementation), and then returns the associated dirty manager.

30. The provided code is the definition of a Java class called `ODirtyManager`. Here's a summary of what this class does:

- The `ODirtyManager` class is used to manage dirty records in an OrientDB database.
- The class has private instance variables including `overrider`, `references`, `newRecords`, and `updateRecords`.
- The class provides various methods for managing and tracking dirty records, such as `setDirty`, `track`, `unTrack`, `getNewRecords`, `getUpdateRecords`, `getReferences`, `merge`, `isSame`, `removeNew`, `removePointed`, `clearForSave`, `clear`, and `getPointed`.
- The `setDirty` method is used to mark a record as dirty, either as a new record or an update to an existing record.
- The `track` and `unTrack` methods are used to track and untrack references between records.
- The `merge` method is used to merge the dirty state of two `ODirtyManager` instances.
- The `isSame` method checks if two `ODirtyManager` instances are the same.
- The class also includes some private helper methods for internal tracking and merging of dirty records.
- The `clearForSave` and `clear` methods are used to clear the dirty state of the `ODirtyManager`.

Overall, the `ODirtyManager` class provides functionality for managing and tracking dirty records in an OrientDB database.
