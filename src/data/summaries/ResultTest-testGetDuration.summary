1. Sure! 

The method `getDuration` is defined as a public method that returns a value of type `String`. 

In this case, the method simply returns the value of a variable called `duration`. It doesn't require any input parameters or perform any complex calculations or manipulations. It is simply a getter method that returns the value of the `duration` variable. 

The access modifier `public` indicates that this method can be accessed from any other class. So, any instance of the `Result` class can call this method to retrieve the value of `duration`.
