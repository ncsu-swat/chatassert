10. In line 7, method `createAvcCBox` of class `AvcCBox` is invoked.
11. This method is a static method called `createAvcCBox` defined in the class `AvcCBox`. It takes in several parameters such as `profile`, `profileCompat`, `level`, `nalLengthSize`, `spsList`, and `ppsList`. 

Inside the method, a new instance of `AvcCBox` is created using the constructor `new AvcCBox(new Header(fourcc()))`. This constructor takes a `Header` object as a parameter, which is created by invoking the `fourcc()` method. 

After creating the `AvcCBox` object, the method assigns the values of the parameters to the corresponding fields of the `AvcCBox` object. These fields include `profile`, `profileCompat`, `level`, `nalLengthSize`, `spsList`, and `ppsList`. 

Finally, the method returns the created `AvcCBox` object.
12. In line 8, method `avcCToAnnexB` of class `H264Utils` is invoked.
13. Certainly! 

The given method is a public static method called `avcCToAnnexB` defined in the class `H264Utils`. It takes an `AvcCBox` object named `avcC` as a parameter.

Inside the method, it calls another method called `saveCodecPrivate` defined elsewhere. This method takes two parameters, `spsList` and `ppsList`, which are obtained from the `avcC` object.

The method `saveCodecPrivate` is responsible for processing the `spsList` (sequence parameter set list) and `ppsList` (picture parameter set list), and converting them into a ByteBuffer in Annex B format.

Finally, the method returns the ByteBuffer obtained from the `saveCodecPrivate` method.
14. In line 8, method `toArray` of class `NIOUtils` is invoked.
15. Certainly! 

The given method is a public static method named `toArray` defined in the class `NIOUtils`. It takes a `ByteBuffer` object named `buffer` as a parameter and returns a byte array.

Inside the method, a new byte array named `result` with the size of `buffer.remaining()` is created. The `buffer.remaining()` method returns the number of elements remaining in the `ByteBuffer`, which represents the number of bytes that can be read from it.

Next, it creates a duplicate of the `buffer` using the `duplicate()` method. The `duplicate()` method creates a new `ByteBuffer` that shares the same content as the original `buffer` object.

Then, it uses the `get()` method of the duplicated `ByteBuffer` to copy the bytes from the `buffer` into the `result` byte array. The `get()` method reads bytes from the `ByteBuffer` into a destination array, in this case, the `result` array.

Finally, it returns the `result` byte array which now contains the copied bytes from the original `buffer`.

17. Take note that in line 1, an object of class `ArrayList` is created.
18. Take note that in line 4, an object of class `ByteBuffer` is created.
19. Take note that in line 4, an object of class `ArrayList` is created.
20. In line 7, an object of class `AvcCBox` is instantiated
21. This Java class is named `AvcCBox` and it belongs to the package `org.jcodec.codecs.h264.mp4`. It extends the `Box` class defined in the `org.jcodec.containers.mp4.boxes` package, indicating that it is a specific type of box in the MP4 container format.

The provided class represents the AVC Configuration Box (`avcC` box) in an MP4 file. This class is responsible for parsing and generating the AVC Codec Configuration data as per the specification.

Here is a breakdown of the key elements and functionalities of the `AvcCBox` class:

- Class members: The class defines several private instance variables including `profile`, `profileCompat`, `level`, `nalLengthSize`, `spsList`, and `ppsList`, which store the corresponding values of the AVC configuration properties.
- Constructor: The class has a constructor that takes a `Header` object as a parameter and initializes the instance variables `spsList` and `ppsList` as new `ArrayList` objects.
- Static methods: The class provides static methods such as `fourcc()`, `parseAvcCBox()`, `createEmpty()`, and `createAvcCBox()` for various operations related to the AVC Configuration Box.
- Overridden methods: The class implements several methods inherited from the `Box` class, including `parse()`, `doWrite()`, and `estimateSize()`. These methods handle the parsing, generation, and estimation of the AVC Configuration Box, respectively.
- Getters: The class provides getter methods for accessing the values of the AVC configuration properties such as `getProfile()`, `getProfileCompat()`, `getLevel()`, `getSpsList()`, `getPpsList()`, and `getNalLengthSize()`.

Overall, the `AvcCBox` class encapsulates the functionality for representing and handling the AVC Codec Configuration Box in an MP4 file. It provides methods for parsing the box data, generating the box data, and accessing the individual AVC configuration properties.
