0. In line 1, method `of` of class `Label` is invoked.
1. The given code defines a static method called `of` in the class `Label`. 

This method takes a single parameter of type `String` named `value`, which represents the text of the label. It is used to create a simple label with the specified text.

The method returns an instance of the `Label` class. In this particular case, it returns a new instance of `Label` by calling its constructor with the provided `value` as the argument. The constructor initializes the `Label` with default values for various properties such as alignment, wrapping, ellipsis, etc.
2. In line 1, method `tail` of class `EndLabel` is invoked.
3. The given code defines a static method called `tail` in the class `EndLabel`.

This method takes three parameters:

1. `label` of type `SimpleLabel`: It represents the base `SimpleLabel` object from which the `EndLabel` will be created.
2. `angle` of type `Double` (nullable): It represents the angle at which the tail label will be positioned relative to the `label`.
3. `distance` of type `Double` (nullable): It represents the distance between the base `label` and the tail label.

The method returns an instance of the `EndLabel` class. In this case, it creates a new `EndLabel` object by calling its constructor with the following arguments:

1. `"taillabel"`: It is a hardcoded string representing the label type.
2. `label.value`: It accesses the `value` field of the `label` object and passes it as an argument to the constructor.
3. `label.html`: It accesses the `html` field of the `label` object and passes it as an argument to the constructor.
4. `angle`: It passes the `angle` argument directly as an argument to the constructor.
5. `distance`: It passes the `distance` argument directly as an argument to the constructor.

The constructor of `EndLabel` initializes the object with the provided values and sets default values for any unspecified properties.
4. In line 1, an object of class `EndLabel` is instantiated
5. The given code defines a class called `EndLabel` which extends the `SimpleLabel` class and implements the `Attributes` interface for `ForLink`.

Here is a breakdown of the class code:

1. The class is declared with the `public final` keywords, meaning that it cannot be extended and can be accessed from outside the package.

2. The class imports the `javax.annotation.Nullable` class and the `java.util.Objects` class.

3. The `EndLabel` class has three private fields:
   - `key` of type `String`: It represents the key associated with the label.
   - `angle` of type `Double` (nullable): It represents the angle at which the label will be positioned relative to its base label.
   - `distance` of type `Double` (nullable): It represents the distance between the label and its base label.

4. The class has a private constructor that takes the `key`, `value`, `html`, `angle`, and `distance` parameters. It calls the constructor of the `SimpleLabel` superclass with the `value` and `html` parameters and assigns the other parameters to the corresponding fields.

5. The class provides two static methods:
   - `head`: It takes a `SimpleLabel` object, an `angle`, and a `distance` as parameters, and creates a new `EndLabel` object with the key "headlabel" and the provided values.
   - `tail`: It takes a `SimpleLabel` object, an `angle`, and a `distance` as parameters, and creates a new `EndLabel` object with the key "taillabel" and the provided values.

6. The class overrides the `applyTo` method from the `Attributes` interface. It adds the current `EndLabel` instance to the provided `MapAttributes` object using the `key` field. If `angle` and `distance` are not null, it adds them to the `attributes` object using specific keys.

7. The class overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods to compare and hash the `key`, `angle`, and `distance` fields along with the corresponding fields inherited from the `SimpleLabel` class.

Overall, the `EndLabel` class is used to represent labels associated with the ends of links in a graph visualization, providing various attributes and methods for customization.
