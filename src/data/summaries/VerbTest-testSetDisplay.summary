0. Take note that in line 1, constructor `HashMap` from class `HashMap` is invoked.
1. Take note that in line 2, method `put` from class `HashMap` is invoked.
2. In line 3, method `setDisplay` of class `Verb` is invoked.
3. Certainly! 

The given method is called `setDisplay` and it belongs to the `Verb` class. It takes one parameter, which is a `HashMap` object named `display`. The method has a `void` return type, indicating that it does not return any value.

Inside the method, `this.display` refers to an instance variable `display` of the `Verb` class. By using the assignment operator (`=`), the value of the parameter `display` is assigned to the instance variable.

In summary, this method is used to set the value of the `display` instance variable in the `Verb` class based on the provided `HashMap` `display` parameter.
4. In line 4, method `getDisplay` of class `Verb` is invoked.
5. Certainly! 

The given method is called `getDisplay` and it belongs to the `Verb` class. It has a return type of `HashMap<String, String>`. 

Inside the method, `return display;` is used to return the value of the `display` instance variable. In this case, `display` is a `HashMap<String, String>`, so the method returns the entire `HashMap` object.

In summary, this method is used to retrieve the value of the `display` instance variable in the `Verb` class, which is a `HashMap<String, String>`.
