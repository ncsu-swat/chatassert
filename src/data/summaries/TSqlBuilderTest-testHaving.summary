0. In line 1, method `select` of class `SqlBuilder` is invoked.
1. Certainly! 

The method you provided is the `select` method of the `SqlBuilder` class. Let's break down the code:

- `public`: This keyword indicates that the method has public access and can be called from any other class.

- `SqlBuilder`: This specifies the return type of the method, which in this case is the `SqlBuilder` class itself. It means that the method will return an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class.

- `select`: This is the name of the method. It takes in one parameter of type `String...` named `columns`. The `String...` syntax is called a varargs parameter and allows the method to accept a variable number of `String` arguments or an array of `String`.

In summary, the `select` method is used to specify the columns that should be selected in a SQL query. It returns an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class to allow method chaining for building complex SQL statements.
2. In line 1, method `from` of class `SqlBuilder` is invoked.
3. Certainly! 

This method code is for the `from` method of the `SqlBuilder` class. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `public`: This keyword indicates that the method has public access and can be called from any other class.

- `SqlBuilder`: This specifies the return type of the method, which in this case is the `SqlBuilder` class itself. It means that the method will return an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class.

- `from`: This is the name of the method. It takes in one parameter of type `String` named `table`. The `String` parameter represents the table name that you want to query from in a SQL statement.

In summary, the `from` method is used to specify the table name in a SQL query. It returns an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class to allow method chaining for building complex SQL statements.
4. In line 1, method `groupBy` of class `SqlBuilder` is invoked.
5. Certainly! 

The code you provided is the method signature for the `groupBy` method of the `SqlBuilder` class. Let's break it down:

- `public`: This keyword indicates that the method has public access and can be called from any other class.

- `SqlBuilder`: This specifies the return type of the method, which in this case is the `SqlBuilder` class itself. It means that the method will return an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class.

- `groupBy`: This is the name of the method. It takes in one parameter of type `String...` named `columns`. The `String...` syntax is called a varargs parameter and allows the method to accept a variable number of `String` arguments or an array of `String`.

In summary, the `groupBy` method is used to specify the columns for grouping in a SQL query. It takes one or more column names as arguments and returns an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class to allow method chaining for building complex SQL statements.
6. In line 1, method `having` of class `SqlBuilder` is invoked.
7. Certainly! 

The method signature you provided is for the `having` method of the `SqlBuilder` class. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `public`: This keyword indicates that the method has public access and can be called from any other class.

- `SqlBuilder`: This specifies the return type of the method, which in this case is the `SqlBuilder` class itself. It means that the method will return an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class.

- `having`: This is the name of the method. It takes in one parameter of type `String...` named `conditions`. The `String...` syntax is called a varargs parameter and allows the method to accept a variable number of `String` arguments or an array of `String`.

In summary, the `having` method is used to specify the conditions for filtering the result of a SQL query. It takes one or more conditions as arguments and returns an instance of the `SqlBuilder` class, allowing method chaining for building complex SQL statements.

For example, you could call the `having` method like this:
```
SqlBuilder sqlBuilder = new SqlBuilder();
sqlBuilder.having("column1 > 10", "column2 IS NULL");
```
This code would set up a `SqlBuilder` object and then use the `having` method to specify two conditions for the query: "column1 > 10" and "column2 IS NULL".
