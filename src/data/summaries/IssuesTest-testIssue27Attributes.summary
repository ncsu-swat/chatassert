0. In line 1, an object of class `XsdParser` is instantiated.
1. This code snippet defines a constructor for the `XsdParser` class. The constructor takes a single parameter `filePath`, which is the path of the XSD file to be parsed.

The constructor's purpose is to parse the given XSD file (`filePath`). Additionally, it will also parse any subsequent XSD files referenced by `xsd:import` and `xsd:include` tags found in the original XSD file.

After parsing all the XSD files, the constructor will resolve any references present in the XSD language, specifically those represented by the `ref` attribute. 

Once the parsing and reference resolution are complete, the results of the parse (XSD schemas and elements) can be accessed using the methods `getResultXsdSchemas()` and `getResultXsdElements()`. Any unsolved references can be obtained using the `getUnsolvedReferences()` method.

The actual parsing of the XSD files is performed by the `parse()` method, which is called within the constructor using the provided `filePath`.

Essentially, this constructor allows you to instantiate an `XsdParser` object and provide an XSD file to parse, with the ability to access the parsing results and unsolved references later on.
2. In line 1, method `getFilePath` of class `IssuesTest` is invoked.
3. This method, named `getFilePath`, is a private static method of the `IssuesTest` class. It takes a single parameter `fileName`, which represents the name of the file that is associated with the test class.

The purpose of this method is to obtain the file path of the specified file. It is commonly used to locate and retrieve the resource file path in test scenarios.

The method begins by calling the `getResource()` method of the `getClassLoader()` object belonging to the `HtmlParseTest` class. This combination of methods tries to find the resource file specified by `fileName` in the classpath.

If the `getResource()` method returns a non-null value, meaning it has successfully found the resource file, the method retrieves the path of the resource using the `getPath()` method of the `URL` class. It then returns this path as a `String`.

However, if the `getResource()` method returns `null`, indicating that the resource file was not found, the method throws a `RuntimeException` with an error message stating that the `issues.xsd` file is missing from the XsdParser resource folder.

In summary, this method serves to retrieve the file path of the specified resource file for use in the `IssuesTest` class.
4. Take note that in line 2, method `toList` from class `Collectors` is invoked.
5. In line 2, method `getResultXsdSchemas` of class `XsdParserCore` is invoked.
6. The method `getResultXsdSchemas` is a public method of the `XsdParserCore` class. This method returns a `Stream` of `XsdSchema` elements that have been parsed by the `XsdParserCore` class.

The method starts by accessing the `parseElements` field, which is a `Map` that stores the parsed XSD elements. It calls the `values()` method to retrieve all the `List` objects contained in the map. Each `List` corresponds to a specific XSD element name.

Then, it converts each `List` into a `Stream` using the `stream()` method. This allows for further stream operations to be performed.

Next, it applies a filter operation using the `filter()` method on each XSD element. It checks if the element's type is an instance of `XsdSchema`, using the `instanceof` operator. Only the elements that are instances of `XsdSchema` will pass this filter.

After the filter operation, it applies a `map()` operation to transform each filtered element into its corresponding `XsdSchema` instance. This is done by casting the element to `XsdSchema` using the `(XsdSchema)` syntax and accessing the element using the `getElement()` method.

Finally, the resulting `Stream` of `XsdSchema` instances is returned by the method.

In summary, this method allows you to retrieve a `Stream` of `XsdSchema` elements that have been parsed by the `XsdParserCore` class. You can then use this `Stream` to navigate through the XSD element tree.
7. Take note that in line 2, method `collect` from class `Stream` is invoked.
8. In line 1, an object of class `XsdParser` is instantiated
9. The provided code represents the `XsdParser` class, which is a core class in the XsdParser project. This class is responsible for parsing XSD files and storing the parse results.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `XsdParser` class is declared in the `org.xmlet.xsdparser.core` package.
2. The class imports various classes and packages for handling XML parsing, exception handling, and configuration.
3. The class extends the `XsdParserCore` class, which is a parent class that provides common parsing functionality.
4. The `XsdParser` class has two constructors. Each constructor takes a `filePath` parameter and triggers the parsing process by calling the `parse()` method.
5. The `parse()` method takes the `filePath` and adds it to the `schemaLocations` list. It then iterates over the `schemaLocations` and calls the `parseFile()` method for each location.
6. The `parseFile()` method starts by checking if the file exists. If the file does not exist and the `filePath` is a relative path, it attempts to find the file based on the parent file's location.
7. The method then sets the current file being parsed and retrieves the configuration for parsing `XsdSchema` elements.
8. It creates a `ParseData` object with the necessary information for parsing, such as the `XsdParser` instance, the schema node, and the visitor function.
9. Finally, it applies the parsing function to the schema node, gets the result as a `ReferenceBase` object, and sets the file path for the `XsdSchema` element.

In addition to the constructors and parsing methods, there are also helper methods like `getSchemaNode()` to obtain the schema node from an XSD file using DOM parsing.

Overall, the `XsdParser` class provides functionality for parsing XSD files, handling file paths, and storing the parse results for further use.
10. In line 2, an object of class `XsdSchema` is instantiated
11. The provided code represents the `XsdSchema` class, which is a class used to model an XSD schema.

Here is an explanation of the different parts of the class:

1. Package and import statements: The class is defined in the `org.xmlet.xsdparser.xsdelements` package and imports various classes and packages needed for the functionality of the class.

2. Class declaration: The class extends the `XsdAnnotatedElements` class and overrides methods inherited from its parent class.

3. Class constants: The class defines three constants - `XSD_TAG`, `XS_TAG`, and `TAG`, which represent the different possible tags for an XSD schema.

4. Class member variables: The class has several private instance variables that represent different properties and information of the XSD schema, such as `attributeFormDefault`, `elementFormDefault`, `blockDefault`, `finalDefault`, `targetNamespace`, `version`, `xmlns`, `filePath`, `namespaces`, and `elements`.

5. Constructor: The class has a private constructor that takes parameters for creating an instance of the `XsdSchema` class. Inside the constructor, the provided parameters are assigned to the corresponding instance variables, with some additional validations and processing.

6. Methods: The class provides various getter and helper methods to access and manipulate the XSD schema's properties and children elements.

7. `parse` method: This method is a static method used to parse an XSD schema. It takes a `ParseData` object as a parameter and returns a `ReferenceBase` object that represents the parsed XSD schema. It further processes the schema, retrieves information about imports, and updates prefix locations.

8. Helper methods: The class provides several helper methods, such as `updatePrefixLocations`, `add`, `resolveNameSpace`, `getChildren*`, etc., to facilitate adding, retrieving, and manipulating the children elements and namespaces of the XSD schema.

Overall, the `XsdSchema` class represents an XSD schema and provides methods to access and manipulate its properties and children elements.

12. Take note that in line 2, an object of class `List` is created.
